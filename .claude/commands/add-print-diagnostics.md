description: Add many diagnostic print statements for each episode and after simulation
---

Add a bunch of diagnostic print statements. There should be a diagnostic print statement each run (aka episode), and then a bunch at the end First brainstorm what variables or other stuff should be printed each run, and which should be printed at the end. The goal is to have the data available to troubleshoot.
