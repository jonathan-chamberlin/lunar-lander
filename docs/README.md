I didn't record videos or the model of the successful exp022, so I did exp023 and recorded those and saved that model.

Video files: C:\Repositories for Git\lunar-lander-file-folder\lunar-lander\experiments\EXP_023_long_training_with_recording\video

Model: C:\Repositories for Git\lunar-lander-file-folder\lunar-lander\experiments\EXP_024_long_training_with_recording\results\models\exp024_model.pt

Good video example of model learning at  C:\Repositories for Git\lunar-lander-file-folder\lunar-lander\experiments\EXP_023_long_training_with_recording\many_episodes.mp4 When the simulation runs longer it ends up landing cleanly and not doing the bouncing behavior shown around run 4000.

I discovered a recording bug where there are frames for more than one episode in an expiriment's frames>episode_XXXX folder
